                I am outgoing, creative, and friendly. I am always in pursuit of mentors who will keep me sharp and share new knowledge.
                I like to meet new people, make friends and help others to become a better version of themselves. Yet, somehow
                I ended up in one of the most introverted careers in the industry, in pursuit of improving the “UI-UX of
                things”.
            </p>
            <p>
                The truth is that I am passionate about programming and I believe that the more we understand others the better developers
                we become. Whether it is a boss or coworker if we are able to listen and see through their eyes we will be
                able to create better and cleaner code. As well as if we understand the client's struggles and needs we could
                bring a Mac/Windows revolution once again.</p>

            <p>
                Therefore, by harnessing my social background and improving my OOP-Design-Pattern skills, I believe I will be able to develop
                software that people will love. </p>
